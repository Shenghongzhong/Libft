## Summary

I came across this paper and spent some time to grab keywords into the note. I will have a look at this note to deepen my understanding. My first recall:

The basic layer of the functions is around `strcat` and `strcpy`. However, they have a problem with buffer overflow. For example, it is difficult to know the size of buffer you want to create to hold the data from user inputs as it could be very dynamic. I saw the examples in paper was saying about users and pathname like `/usr/home`



## strlcpy and stlcat - consistent, safe, string copy and concatenation

### Abstract
* buffer overflow attack
* size or length-bounded string function
* strncpy(), strncat() are safe versions of strcpy() and strcat()
	* NUL-termination
	* length parameter
	* truncation detection isn't easy
	* strncpy() -> zero-fills the remainder of the destination string
	* performance penalty
* the length parameters & realted issues of NUL-termination 
* miuse of strncpy(), strncat()
* security holes
* strlcpy, strlcat no zero-fills unused bytes 


## Introduction 
- security problems > buffer overflows
- BugTraq
- a large number of overflow <- unbounded string <- `sprintf()`, `strcpy()`, `strcat()`, without explicit length check in the loop invariant
- unsafe sage of functions -> `strcpy()` , `strcat()`
- incoorect usage of `strncpy()`, `strnct`
- not obvious -> `static` variables - buffer allocated via `calloc()` -> pre-terminated 
- foolproof

## Common Misconceptions

- 1 misconception -> `strncpy()` NUL-terminates the destination string
	- if length of the source string is less than the size parameter 
	- if length of the source string is more or equal to the size parameter, `strncpy()` will not terminate the desination string
- copying user input - arbitrary length into a fixed size buffer
- safest way -`strncpy()` pass it one less than the size of the destination string and then terminate the string by hand
	- always NUL-terminated  destination string
- not static variable , not necessary to terminate the string
- `calloc()` , strings zeroed out when allocated
- an implicit assumption
	- converting code from `strcpy()`, `strcat()` to `strncpy()` `strncat()`
	- negligible performance degradation
	- zero-fills the remaining bytes not used in string
	- measurable performance hit -> size of the destination string greater the length of the source string
		- how bad it could be - depends on CPU architecture and implementation
- common mistaks
	- incorrect size parameter
	- not count the space for the NUL in the size parameter
	- not the size of the destination , it is the amount of space available


## How do strlcpy() and `strlcat` help things?

- bullet-proof code
- `strlcat()` and `strlcpy()` guarantee to NULL-terminate the destination string
- aslong as the size parameter is non-zero
- both take full-size of the destination string as the `size` parameter
- easy to compute at compile time, using the `sizeof` operator
- no zero-fill destination strings

- both return value
	- total length of the string - create
	- `strlcpy()` the length of he source
	- `strlcat()` the length of the destination (before concatenation) + the length of the source
	- similar semantics  to return value of snprintf()

- how to check for truncation
	- only verify if the return value is less than the size parameter
		- if truncation yes, the number of bytes stored the entire string could be known
			- allocate more space, re-copy strings 
		- if truncation no, length of the resulting string which is less than the size parameter
- `strlen()` no need



### Example 1a - potential buffer overflow 

```
strcpy(path, homedir);
strcat(path, "/");
strcat(path, ".foorc");
len = strlen(path);
```

HOME environment variable -> by users, could be arbitrary length 

### Example 1b - Converted to `strncpy()` and `strncat()` safely

```
// homedir : "/usr/home"
// len is 9, size is 10 (including NUL)
strncpy(path, homedir, sizeof(path)-1);
// path : "/usr/home"
// manual nul-terminate the string when using strncpy
path[sizeof(path) - 1] = '\0';
// first count the length of path
// second 
strncat(path, "/", sizeof(path) - strlen(path) - 1);
strncat(path, ".foorc", sizeof(path) - strlen(path)-1);

```

finally I figured out about why this line of code as a size parameter.

`sizeof(path) - strlen(path) - 1` you are telling the function how much offset it can concatenate 

### Example 1c - Trivial conversion - simplify the strncpy and strncat with strlcpy and strlcat

```
strlcpy(path, homedir, sizeof(path));
strlcat(path, "/", sizeof(path));
strlcat(path, ".foorc", sizeof(path));
len = strlen(path);`
```

### Example 1d:  With a check for truncation

```
len = strlcpy(path, homedir,
sizeof(path);
if (len >= sizeof(path))
return (ENAMETOOLONG);
len = strlcat(path, "/",
sizeof(path);
if (len >= sizeof(path))
return (ENAMETOOLONG);
len = strlcat(path, ".foorc",
sizeof(path));
if (len >= sizeof(path))
return (ENAMETOOLONG);
```

`ENAMETOOLONG` is used as a return value in certain conditions. `ENAMETOOLONG` is typically a symbolic constant defined in standard C library headers and represents an error code that indicates that the provided file or path name is too long.


### Design decisions

- the semantics of strlcpy() and strlcat()
	- they looked back to how people use or misues `strncat` 
	- size parameter for `strlcat` should be the full size of the string, not just the number of characters left unallocatd
	- same semantics as sprintf
- truncation detection & recovery

### Performance
- target buffer is significantly larger than the length of the source string -> avoid `strncpy()` -> performance penalty
- example -> apache group - used internal function - noticed a performance improvement
- > we ran a test program that copies the string this is just a test'' 1000 times into a 1024 byte buffer. This is somewhat unfair to strncpy(), since by using a small string and a large buffer strncpy() has to fill most of the buffer with NUL characters.
- common practice -> larger buffer for user input
- pathname buffers <-> `MAXPATHLEN` (1024 bytes)


### What `strlcpy()` and `strlcat()` are not

- While strlcpy() and strlcat() are well-suited for dealing with fixed-size buffers, they cannot replace strncpy() and strncat() in all cases.
- Sometimes,  buffer may not be true C strings
