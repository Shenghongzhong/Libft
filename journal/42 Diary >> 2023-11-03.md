I googled STRLCAT 实现  and I found out about this paper about how to design the function of `strlcat` https://gratisoft.us/todd/papers/strlcpy.html and Chinese https://blog.csdn.net/kailan818/article/details/6731772 ; of course the old one is https://c-for-dummies.com/blog/?p=3896

Also I found out about another strategy: reading paper!

see, I thought I didn't know how to do it but I found out about some academic reading can help me a lot though!
