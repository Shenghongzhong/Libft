I am feeling a huge block about writing C code.

### ft_strlcpy.c

I read paper about the `strlcpy`, essentially the design of function is to deal with the buffer overflow. Regardlessly, the return value is the total length of source string. Because this can help you detect the truncation. if you give a size parameter is smaller than, you can see the return value. so you know what to modify. On the other hand, if you can give the size is zero, there will be return value for the total length of source string.



i tested it many times, so if the `size` parameter is smaller than the total length of destination string. what will happen is that the return value of `ft_strlcat` will be the size + the total length of source string. Unlike what was written in the `man` page

> Note, however, that if `strlcat()` traverses `size` characters without finding a NUL, the length of the string is considered to be `size` and the destination string will not be NUL-terminated since there was no space for the NUL. 

To me, it is not very crystal clear. but I tested with the original code and found out if the `size` is smaller than the length of the destination of string, the return value will be the sum of the `size` and the length of source string.

I found out about the original code [here](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-262/string/strlcat.c.auto.html)

it is interesting to see how the author logic works.

first of all, there are 3 parameters `dst`, `src`, `siz`
the author declared 4 variables such as `char *d`, `const char *s` and `size_t n` to safely assign them with those parameters. of which, there is a variable `size_t dlen`

then it 's a while loop. n is equal to size. so 

#### Underflow

I saw the lines of code 
```
while (n-- != 0 && d != '\0')
	d++;
dlen = d - dst;
n = size - dlen;
```

I was thinking about what if the variable `n` could be smaller than the actual length of `dst`. What will happen?

I quickly developed a sample code 

```
1   #include <stdio.h>
  1 
  2 int     main()
  3 {
  4         size_t n;
  5         n = 0;
  6         n = 1 - 8;
  7 
  8         printf("%zu\n", n);
  9         return (0);
 10 }
```

but the result of output was

I was pretty sure about the data type issue. `n` is unsigned integer which is `size_t`. but the calculation is `n = 1 - 8;` which is negative value `-7`. a variable with a data type `size_t` cannot represent negative values. it will wrap around in a way that leads to a undesired behaviour. 

but I learned that ![](https://i.imgur.com/lV388Pi.png)
is actually the maximum representable value for a 64-bit `size_t`, which is equivalent to 2^64 - 7. this is the result of underflow when trying to represent a negative value in an unsigned integer type.

for now let's ignore the extreme situation.

but I learn that you can shorten your code into one line like this

```
while (n-- != 0 && d != '\0'`)
	d++;
```

However, in summary, `ft_strlcat` will return the sum of size + total length of source string due to the last line of code `d_len + ft_strlen(src);`


### ft_strchr

my code didn't pass one test `/* 5 */ check(ft_strchr(s, 't' + 256) == s); showLeaks();`

I asked chatGPT about what it means and why it didn't work. ChatGPT told me that **Characters in C are typically ranging from 0 - 255. or (-128 to 127). * 

in the test code, 't' + 256 is an out-of-range value greater than 255. so the function is searching for an invalid character in the string. Hence it doesn't work.

in my original code, I didn't do type casting. because when you do type casting, you will get the value of 0.

```
int intValue = 256;
char charValue = (char)intValue;

printf("%d\n", charValue);
```

because the valid range value for character is 0 - 255 or ( -128 to 127); when it is 256 or -129, it is outside the valid range value of character. it will return 0. in this case, `t` + 256 will be t + 0 which is 116 in the end...`t`

```
 1 #include <stdio.h>
  2 
  3 int     main()
  4 {
  5         int intValue = 't' + 256;
  6         char charValue = (char)intValue;
  7         printf("%d\n", charValue);
  8 }
```
