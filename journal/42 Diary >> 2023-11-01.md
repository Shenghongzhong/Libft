- I talked with Chris about memcpy and memmove.

he helped me understand why 42 school works.
I need peers to help, especially for people who is advanced than me. 
I need to be humble.

When it comes to memory management, we are talking about the whole area
because the memory block doesn't have any boundary.
How memory works is that we have a pointer to pointing to the first memory address, it is going to expand.

When it comes to mem series, it is about just one memory block.
it isn't about string operation, hence sometimes you may see some strings are not clean.

my mistake is to confuse myself about memory block and strings

so I need to be careful about this.
